# US_Obesity_Analysis
BT4015 Group Project: 
Obesity is a common, serious, and costly chronic disease. It puts people at risk for several serious chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, certain forms of cancer, and sleep-breathing disorders. Besides being a long-term major health concern in the United States, it has also been discovered that obesity will increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 in recent studies. Given such a backdrop, we analyse county-wise obesity data for the 48 adjoining U.S. states together with the geological and socioeconomic factors that might indicate or even contribute to the emergence of obesity cases.
